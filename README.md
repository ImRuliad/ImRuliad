About Me
---
- 👾 I'm an incoming intern at Intel where I will be writing software to debug silicon.

- 🎯 I've also interned at SMUD designing, developing, testing, and implementing a database using sqlite3, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQL Server Management Studio to eliminate over ***100*** data silos. I also find myself doing a fair bit of data analysis and ETL workflow development.
  
- 🧑‍🏫 Data Structures & Algorithms club president, holding group leetcode sessions of over 20 students, mock interviews, and industry speaker events.

- ⚡️ Recently became engulfed in hardware, learning computer architecture and organization, prompting me to learn HDL, Verilog, and FPGA programming. I am currently reading [*What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory*](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)

- 🦠 I have a keen interest in cellular automata and often read [Stephen Wolfram's writings.](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/)

- 🎶 If I'm not listening to a podcast or in a deep work/study session you can find me listening to a wide gamut of artists like Deftones, System of a Down, TOPS, and Men I Trust.
